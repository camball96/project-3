## Description
Ol' Mate is a social media application that is designed for the older generation. My app takes into consideration that the older generation today can easily feel overwhelmed with all the latest and greatest tech going into the current social media apps. Ol' Mate offers an easy to use UI that is still modern, minimistic and easy to navigate. With the core components all featuring large text, images and clear instructions.

- Users are able to see previous posts by other users

## Development
My main goal was to build a full stack application that helps the older generation use the new tech of social media without feeling overwhelmed with feautures that are
not relevant to them.

## Future
Due to the time constraints given for completion of this project, I had to scale back a lot of potential features. Moving foward, I would like to add the following;

1. Finish the original idea - complete New posts to work, see comments and update likes counter
2. Adding friends functionality
3. More accessibility settings - speech to text, icons, make text slider work etc
4. Message service
